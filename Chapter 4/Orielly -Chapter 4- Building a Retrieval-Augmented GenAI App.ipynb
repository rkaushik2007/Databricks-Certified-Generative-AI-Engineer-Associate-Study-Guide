    "# Hands-On Lab: Building a Retrieval-Augmented GenAI App\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario\n",
    "You are a data engineer working for a knowledge-intensive enterprise. Your team has been asked to build a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) application that allows employees to query internal documents such as compliance manuals, product specifications, and policy handbooks using large language models (LLMs). The challenge is to ensure that responses are not only fluent but also factually accurate, contextually grounded, and compliant with organizational standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab mirrors a real-world enterprise use case where accuracy, governance, and safety are critical. Source documents are lengthy, inconsistently formatted, and may contain sensitive information. The system must retrieve only approved content, minimize hallucinations, and clearly handle situations where sufficient evidence is not available.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, you must:\n",
    "- Extract, clean, and chunk internal documents so they can be used effectively for retrieval\n",
    "- Store and index document embeddings in a vector database\n",
    "- Connect a retriever to query the indexed knowledge base\n",
    "- Integrate the retriever with an LLM using a LangChain pipeline\n",
    "- Ground model responses strictly in retrieved content\n",
    "- Apply prompt-level safety instructions to prevent hallucinations and unsafe disclosures\n",
    "- Qualitatively evaluate responses for grounding, safety, and reliability\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Build a LangChain pipeline that combines document retrieval with an LLM\n",
    "- Configure a vector store retriever to return relevant, semantically similar context\n",
    "- Apply chunking and indexing strategies that improve retrieval quality\n",
    "- Enforce grounding-focused prompt instructions that require evidence-based answers\n",
    "- Demonstrate how retrieval augmentation reduces hallucinations compared to prompt-only approaches\n",
    "- Qualitatively assess model outputs for factual accuracy, safety risks, and policy compliance\n",
    "- Identify common failure modes (such as unsupported claims or sensitive data exposure) and propose mitigations\n"

    "  - Use hybrid search (keyword + semantic)\n",
    "  - Implement query expansion or reformulation\n",

    "**Failure Mode 2: Context Overflow**\n",
    "- **Problem**: Too many chunks exceed LLM context window\n",
    "- **Causes**: Large k value, long documents, inefficient chunking\n",
    "- **Mitigations**:\n",
    "  - Reduce k parameter\n",
    "  - Implement re-ranking to select best chunks\n",
    "  - Use map-reduce or refine chains for long contexts\n",
    "  - Compress or summarize retrieved chunks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Failure Mode 3: Hallucination Despite Retrieval**\n",
    "- **Problem**: LLM generates information not in context\n",
    "- **Causes**: Weak prompt instructions, high temperature, model limitations\n",
    "- **Mitigations**:\n",
    "  - Strengthen prompt with explicit constraints\n",
    "  - Set temperature to 0\n",
    "  - Use citation-based prompting\n",
    "  - Implement post-processing validation\n",

    "- **Problem**: System returns confidential information inappropriately\n",
    "- **Causes**: Inadequate access controls, poor document filtering\n",

    "  - Implement user-based document filtering\n",

    "### Step 13: Summary and Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "**What We've Accomplished:**\n",
    "1. ✓ Built a Databricks-native RAG pipeline using modern LangChain architecture\n",
    "2. ✓ Stored documents in Delta Lake with Unity Catalog governance\n",
    "3. ✓ Created Databricks Vector Search index with automatic embedding generation\n",
    "4. ✓ Used Databricks Foundation Model APIs (DBRX) for LLM inference\n",
    "5. ✓ Created a safety-focused prompt to prevent hallucinations\n",
    "6. ✓ Demonstrated RAG superiority over prompt-only approaches\n",
    "7. ✓ Established qualitative evaluation framework\n",
    "8. ✓ Identified common failure modes and mitigations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "- **Databricks-Native**: All components run within Databricks (no external dependencies)\n",
    "- **Unity Catalog**: Centralized governance, access control, and audit logging\n",
    "- **Vector Search**: Managed, scalable vector database with auto-sync\n",
    "- **Foundation Models**: No API keys, built-in governance, cost optimization\n",
    "- **Modern APIs**: Use `create_retrieval_chain` instead of deprecated `RetrievalQA`\n",
    "- **Prompt Engineering**: Explicit safety instructions are critical\n",
    "- **Evaluation**: Assess grounding, safety, and hallucination prevention\n",
    "\n",
    "**Databricks Production Advantages:**\n",
    "1. **Scalability**: Vector Search handles billions of vectors with sub-second latency\n",
    "2. **Governance**: Unity Catalog provides centralized access control and audit trails\n",
    "3. **Auto-Sync**: Vector index automatically updates when source Delta table changes\n",
    "4. **Cost Optimization**: Pay-per-use serverless endpoints, no external API costs\n",
    "5. **Security**: Data never leaves your Databricks workspace\n",
    "6. **Monitoring**: Built-in logging and monitoring through Databricks UI\n",
    "7. **Compliance**: Meets enterprise security and regulatory requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "- Implement user-based access control using Unity Catalog permissions\n",
    "- Set up continuous sync for real-time document updates\n",
    "- Add hybrid search combining keyword and semantic search\n",
    "- Implement re-ranking to improve retrieval quality\n",
    "- Create Databricks workflows for automated document ingestion\n",
    "- Set up MLflow tracking for RAG performance monitoring\n",
    "- Explore Databricks Model Serving for production deployment\n"
