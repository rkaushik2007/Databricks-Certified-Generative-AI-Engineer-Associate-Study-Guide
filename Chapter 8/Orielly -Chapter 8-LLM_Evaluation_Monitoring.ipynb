    "## Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "You are an **LLM operations engineer** responsible for managing a production question-answering system used by internal employees across your organization. The system relies on a large language model deployed through **Databricks Model Serving**. In recent weeks, users have reported:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inconsistent answer quality**\n",
    "- **Occasional latency spikes**\n",
    "- **Rising usage costs**\n",
    "\n",
    "Leadership has asked you to diagnose these issues, evaluate system performance, and implement improvements using Databricks monitoring and evaluation tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Workflow in This Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Running structured evaluations** using MLflow to measure latency, token usage, and groundedness\n",
    "2. **Querying inference tables** to identify patterns in real-world traffic, including token growth and slow prompts\n",
    "3. **Using monitoring dashboards and agent traces** to investigate multi-step workflows\n",
    "4. **Detecting anomalies and configuring alert conditions** for early issue detection\n",
    "5. **Applying cost-optimization techniques** such as prompt refinement and context control\n",
    "6. **Validating improvements** with repeatable evaluation runs\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab mirrors real-world LLM observability and optimization challenges, where reliable performance and controlled operational cost are essential to business continuity. It also applies the best practices introduced throughout Chapter 8, including evaluation-dataset versioning, baseline-driven dashboard analysis, calibrated alerting strategies, and recurring review cycles that help maintain long-term system health. By completing this lab, you will integrate evaluation, monitoring, and optimization workflows to achieve end-to-end operational excellence.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ✅ **Design an end-to-end evaluation and monitoring workflow** for a production LLM system on Databricks\n",
    "2. ✅ **Compare multiple model or prompt configurations** using MLflow evaluation metrics and justify a deployment choice\n",
    "3. ✅ **Analyze inference tables** to diagnose latency, token usage, and RAG grounding issues\n",
    "4. ✅ **Distinguish retrieval failures from model or prompt failures** using inference logs\n",
    "5. ✅ **Use agent monitoring** to analyze multi-step workflows and identify inefficiencies\n",
    "6. ✅ **Apply Databricks-native cost controls** and validate cost-saving changes without degrading output quality\n",
    "7. ✅ **Select appropriate evaluation judges** and determine when ground truth is required\n",

    "\n",
    "**How our evaluation works:**\n",

    "   def evaluate_groundedness(question: str, context: str, answer: str) -> int:\n",
    "       # Use LLM-as-judge to score the output\n",
    "       return score  # 1-5\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Function parameters**: Each function receives explicit parameters:\n",
    "   - `question`: The user's question\n",
    "   - `context`: The retrieved context (for groundedness)\n",
    "   - `answer`: The model's generated response\n",
    "   - `ground_truth`: Expected answer (for correctness)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **LLM-as-Judge pattern**: We use Llama 8B to evaluate responses\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **MLflow 3 compatibility**: We also provide wrapper functions (`groundedness_scorer`, `correctness_scorer`) that follow the MLflow 3 `@scorer` signature for use with `mlflow.genai.evaluate()` if available.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this approach?**\n",
    "- Clear, explicit function signatures\n",
    "- Easy to understand and debug\n",
    "- Compatible with both manual evaluation and MLflow 3 GenAI API"

    "**What we're doing:** Running our custom scorers on each sample and logging results to MLflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How the new GenAI API works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prepare data in new format**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   eval_data_for_genai.append({\n",
    "       \"inputs\": {\"question\": ..., \"context\": ...},\n",
    "       \"outputs\": row[\"output\"],\n",
    "       \"expectations\": {\"ground_truth\": ...}\n",
    "   })\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Call evaluation functions directly**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   g_score = evaluate_groundedness(question=..., context=..., answer=...)\n",
    "   c_score = evaluate_correctness(question=..., ground_truth=..., answer=...)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Each function calls the judge LLM (Llama 8B)\n",
    "   - Returns a score from 1-5\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Log aggregate metrics**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   mlflow.log_metric(\"groundedness_mean\", avg_groundedness)\n",
    "   mlflow.log_metric(\"answer_correctness_mean\", avg_correctness)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this approach?** We use explicit function calls for clarity and control. The MLflow 3 compatible wrappers (`groundedness_scorer`, `correctness_scorer`) can be used with `mlflow.genai.evaluate()` if available."

    "When evaluating LLM outputs, you must choose the right evaluation approach. This decision depends on what you're measuring and what reference data you have available.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Trace ID generation**: Each query gets a unique ID for correlation:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   trace_id = str(uuid.uuid4())[:8]  # e.g., \"a1b2c3d4\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Step-by-step timing**: Each pipeline step is timed:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   start = time.time()\n",
    "   result = self.preprocess_query(question)\n",
    "   latency_ms = (time.time() - start) * 1000\n",
    "   trace_record[\"steps\"].append({\"step\": \"preprocess\", \"latency_ms\": latency_ms})\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Pipeline steps traced**:\n",
    "   | Step | What it does | Typical time |\n",
    "   |------|-------------|--------------|\n",
    "   | preprocess | Clean/normalize question | 1-5ms |\n",
    "   | retrieve | Find relevant context | 5-20ms |\n",
    "   | generate | LLM API call | 200-2000ms |\n",
    "   | postprocess | Format response | 1-5ms |\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Trace log storage**: All traces stored in `traced_agent.trace_log` for analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why trace?** The LLM call typically dominates latency (>95%), but tracing helps identify when other steps become bottlenecks (e.g., slow retrieval from a vector database)."

    "**What we're doing:** Scanning our traffic data to find requests that deviate significantly from normal patterns.\n",

    "**How the `analyze_batch()` method works:**\n",

    "1. **Iterate through each request**:\n",

    "   for idx, row in df.iterrows():\n",
    "       is_anomaly, z_score = self.detect_latency_anomaly(row['latency_ms'])\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Z-score calculation** for each metric:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   z_score = (value - mean) / std_dev\n",
    "   # If z_score > 3, the value is 3+ standard deviations from mean\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Anomaly types detected**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   | Type | Detection Method | Threshold |\n",
    "   |------|-----------------|-----------|\n",
    "   | Latency | Z-score > 3 | ~99.7% of normal data is below this |\n",
    "   | Tokens | Z-score > 2 | ~95% of normal data is below this |\n",
    "   | Error Rate | Rate > 5% | Fixed threshold based on SLA |\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Output structure**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   {\n",
    "       'latency_anomalies': [{'request_id': 'x', 'latency_ms': 5000, 'z_score': 4.2}],\n",
    "       'token_anomalies': [...],\n",
    "       'error_rate_anomaly': True/False,\n",
    "       'current_error_rate': 0.03\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Z-scores?** They're distribution-agnostic and automatically adapt to your baseline. A Z-score of 3 means \"this is extremely unusual\" regardless of whether your mean latency is 100ms or 1000ms."

    "   | Metric | Baseline | Optimized | Goal |\n",
    "   |--------|----------|-----------|------|\n",
    "   | Input tokens | ~300 | ~150 | 50% reduction |\n",

    "   | Quality | 0.85 | 0.80+ | Minimal degradation |\n",

    "3. **Cost calculation**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Typical pricing: $0.002 per 1K tokens\n",
    "   baseline_cost = baseline_tokens * 0.002 / 1000\n",

    "\n",
    "**The trade-off:** Aggressive optimization saves money but may reduce answer quality. The goal is finding the sweet spot where you save 30-50% on tokens while maintaining >95% of baseline quality."
